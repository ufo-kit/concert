Concert changelog
=================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Concert release.

Version 0.5
-----------

API breaks:

- Renamed ``concert.helpers.multicast`` to ``broadcast`` to reflect its true
  purpose.


Version 0.4
-----------

Released on October 7th 2013.

Improvements:

- Tests and rotation axis alignment is faster now.
- Soft limits were added to the parameter (accessible with ``.lower`` and
  ``.upper``)
- Cleaner inet connection implemention.
- Base pumps and scales were added.
- Concert no longer depends on testfixtures for running tests.
- Started work on flexible data processing schemes for light computation based
  on a coroutine approach.
- Integrated tifffile.py in case libtiff is not available.
- ``concert mv`` renames sessions.
- ``@threaded`` decorator can be used to run a function in its own thread.
- ``Scanner`` parameters can now be set in the constructor.
- Parameters can now be locked independently of the parent device. However, if
  done so, no one else can lock the device.
- Add ``code_of`` function to show the source of a function.
- Introduced coroutine based data processing facility.

API breaks:

- Renamed ``to_steps`` to ``to_device`` and do not drop units
- ``camera.grab`` returns `None` if no data is available
- ``uca.Camera`` exposes the wrapped GObject camera as an attribute called
  ``uca`` instead of ``camera``.
- ``minimum``, ``maximum`` and ``intervals`` are now longer implemented as
  ``Parameter`` objects of ``Scanner`` but simple attributes.
- ``asynchronous`` module content has been moved to ``helpers``
- Removed ``Scanner`` class in favor of ``scan`` function.

Fixes:

- Integration with all IPython releases works again.
- runtests.py returns 0 on success.
- #19, #55, #71, #78, #79


Version 0.3
-----------

Released on August 19th 2013.

*Note*: This release breaks Python 2.6 compatibility!

- ``Calibration`` classes moved to ``concert.devices.calibration``
- Remove ``concert.processes.focus`` and reorganize ``concert.optimization``
  package, the focusing can be implemented by Maximizer with a proper feedback.
- Add ``--repo`` parameter to the ``fetch`` command. With this flag, session
  files version controlled with Git can be imported.
- Use pint instead of quantities. pint is faster for smaller Numpy arrays,
  stricter and does not depend on Numpy.
- Things can now run serialized if ``concert.asynchronous.DISABLE`` is set to
  ``True``.
- Restructured tests into separate directories.
- Fix PDF generation of the docs.
- Fix problem with IPython version >= 0.10.

- Code cleanup

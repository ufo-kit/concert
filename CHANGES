Concert changelog
=================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Concert release.

Version 0.3
-----------

Released on August 19th 2013.

*Note*: This release breaks Python 2.6 compatibility!

- ``Calibration`` classes moved to ``concert.devices.calibration``
- Remove ``concert.processes.focus`` and reorganize ``concert.optimization``
  package, the focusing can be implemented by Maximizer with a proper feedback.
- Add ``--repo`` parameter to the ``fetch`` command. With this flag, session
  files version controlled with Git can be imported.
- Use pint instead of quantities. pint is faster for smaller Numpy arrays,
  stricter and does not depend on Numpy.

  ``True``.
- Restructured tests into separate directories.
- Fix PDF generation of the docs.

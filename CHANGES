Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Concert release.


Version 0.32
------------

Released on June 20th 2024.


Features
~~~~~~~~

- it is possible to specify rights on writing frames
- added PCO timestamp check addon
- added ImageWithMetadata for camera frames and store the metadata in tiff files


Version 0.33
------------

First decentralized release.

Notes
~~~~~

- camera.stream stashes the trigger_source and restores it 


Version 0.31
------------

Released on May 11th 2022.


Features
~~~~~~~~

- it is possible to use ``await`` statements in concert sessions outside of
  ``async def`` functions
- ``AsyncObject`` allows us to have async constructors ``async def __ainit__``,
  which is very useful when we need to use async code in constructors, e.g.
  setting a parameter on a device
- Experiments were greatly extended by classes which can be customized and run
  at beam lines without many more changes
- Monochromators were enhanced
- Experiment director was introduced to take care of high-throughput
  measurements
- Experiments can write metadata to json
- Parameter limits getters and setters are coroutine functions
- Add ElementSelector device for having discrete choices
- ``ascan`` allows one to include the ``stop`` value in the scan
- walkers have ``create_writer`` method for convenience
- walkers can be used in ``async with`` statements for safe access from multiple
  concurrent coroutines
- ``concert.coroutines.sinks.Accumulate`` allows non-re-setting behavior
  between runs
- ``concert.processes.common.align_rotation_axis`` allows multiple frame
  consumers
- ``concert.devices.cameras.uca.Camera`` gets state from the libuca object


API breaks
~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Parameterizable`` inherits from ``AsyncObject`` which needs an ``__ainit__``
constructor, so every sub-class must change its ``__init__`` to ``async def
__ainit__``.
- ``run_in_loop_thread_blocking`` is gone in favour of using one event loop and
  ``__ainit__`` constructors


Notes
~~~~~

- we replaced Travis by CircleCI

Version 0.30
------------

- Simplify scans, no ``Region`` and no need of using ``resolve`` on the result


Features
~~~~~~~~

- concurrency transition to asyncio, from user perspective the usage is more or
  less the same, e.g. ``motor.move(1 * q.mm)`` starts relative motion in the
  background, ``motor.position = 1 * q.mm`` sets the position in a blocking way.
- ctrl-k cancels all background commands and calls ``emergency_stop`` on all
  devices in the session
- Online reconstruction is capable of doing the flat correction with image
  averaging
- ``concert.experiments.addons.ImageWriter`` blocks for every acquisition


Viewers
-------

- Subclass Parameterizeable, properties turned into parameters
- Added Simple matplotlib backend without colorbar but faster
- Added PyQtGraphViewer
- Added downsampling parameter
- Added show_refresh_rate parameter
- Parameter limits accepts "stream", i.e. the limits are updated for the first
  image of __call__ and then kept the same, "auto" updates limits for every
  image and a tuple fixes them to min and max.


API breaks
~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed ``queue``, ``sinograms``, ``backproject``, ``PickSlice``, ``process``
  coroutines from ``concert.coroutines.filters``
- Removed ``Backproject``, ``FlatCorrectedBackproject``, ``FlatCorrect`` (was
  there twice), ``center_rotation_axis``, ``compute_rotation_axis`` from
  ``concert.ext.ufo``
- Removed ``concert.networking.aerotech`` and ``concert.networking.wago``
- Removed ``concert.devices.motors.crio``
- Removed ``concert.helpers.hasattr_raise_exceptions``
- Removed ``Future.cancel_operation``, cancellation is implemented via
  ``asyncio.CancelledError``
- Removed ``concert.helpers.Region``
- Removed devices:
    - ``concert.devices.motors.aerotech``
    - ``concert.devices.io.aerotech``
    - ``concert.devices.lightsources.fiberlite``
    - ``concert.devices.lightsources.led.``
    - ``concert.devices.photodiodes.edmundoptics``
    - ``concert.devices.scales.adventurer``
    - ``concert.devices.monochromators.newport.py``
- Removed processes:
    - ``concert.processes.common.find_beam``
    - ``concert.processes.common.drift_to_beam``
    - ``concert.processes.common.center_to_beam``
    - ``concert.processes.common.scan_param_feedback``
- Removed callbacks from ``concert.processes.common.scan``
- Removed ``concert.experiments.base.Acquisition.connect`` for simplicity, i.e.
  the acquisition and consumption of data happens always at the same time, for
  special behavior, special classes/functions should be used
- ``Device.abort`` replaced by ``Device.emergency_stop``
- many functions which were not asynchronous before are now, e.g.
  ``Camera.start_recording``

-----------

Released on December 10th 2013.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  and restore them later with ``restore``.

  within the class constructor.
- ``concert.storage.create_folder`` renamed to
  ``concert.storage.create_directory``

- Many more concerning the camera implementation.


Version 0.5
-----------

Released on October 31st 2013.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Experiments can now be modelled with the ``concert.experiments`` module.
- ``concert.ext.viewers.PyplotViewer`` can be used to show 2D image data.
- Spyder command plugin is now available. That means if you have Spyder
  installed you can control Concert from an IDE instead of from IPython.

  buffer.

- Parameters can now be locked independently of the parent device. However, if
  done so, no one else can lock the device.
- Add ``code_of`` function to show the source of a function.
- Introduced coroutine based data processing facility.

API breaks
~~~~~~~~~~

- Renamed ``to_steps`` to ``to_device`` and do not drop units
- ``camera.grab`` returns `None` if no data is available

  ``uca`` instead of ``camera``.
- ``minimum``, ``maximum`` and ``intervals`` are now longer implemented as
  ``Parameter`` objects of ``Scanner`` but simple attributes.
- ``asynchronous`` module content has been moved to ``helpers``
- Removed ``Scanner`` class in favor of ``scan`` function.

-----------

Released on August 19th 2013.

*Note*: This release breaks Python 2.6 compatibility!

- Remove ``concert.processes.focus`` and reorganize ``concert.optimization``
  package, the focusing can be implemented by Maximizer with a proper feedback.

  files version controlled with Git can be imported.
- Use pint instead of quantities. pint is faster for smaller Numpy arrays,
  stricter and does not depend on Numpy.

  must be imported from ``concert.ext.nexus``.
- Adds ``concert fetch`` to pull session files from remote locations.
- Code cleanup


Version 0.1.1
-------------

Bug fix release, released on May 25th 2013

- Fixes Python 3 support.

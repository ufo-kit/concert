        A simple focusing process using gradient as a measure. It maximizes
        it and if the difference between to consequently taken points is
        smaller than an epsilon it stops the process. The gradient function,
        which depends on the position is not monotonic, thus the following
        case might happen:

        g(x1) = g(x2), x1 != x2 and x1 != x2 != axis position for global
        maximum of the gradient.

        True, the method does not block and returns immediately. After the
